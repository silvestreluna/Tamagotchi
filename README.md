# Tamagotchi

## Description

This web page is a digital virtual pet, like the famous 90's game, Tamagotchi.

The page is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant has its own activity and a progress bar that represent the status of each activity. At the bottom of the page, there is the main progress bar that gets updated based on the status of all the other activities progress. 

Each quadrant has two bottoms that will either increase or decrease the progress percentage.
